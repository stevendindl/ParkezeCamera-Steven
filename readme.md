# YOLOv5 Model trained on Parking Data

## Usage
- The model and associated code may be run internally within our organization on our own servers for analytics, monitoring, or research purposes.
- Results produced by the model (e.g., detection counts, bounding boxes, or summary reports) may be shared externally (including with vendors or partners) without restriction.
- External users (vendors, clients, or third parties) may not directly use or host this model or any software incorporating it unless the complete source code of the system is made available under the same AGPL-3.0 license terms.
